Inspired by "Doing Math With Python" by Amit Saha

Run the code to generate an image of the Mandelbrot Set

This Mandelbrot set is derived from the function f(z) = z^2 + c

It is the set of all complex numbers 'c' for which the function does not diverge to infinity when continuously added together started at z = 0. 

In other words, when the sequence f(0), f(f(0), f(f(f(0), etc. remains bounded

Here you have examples of the code in both Python and R!
